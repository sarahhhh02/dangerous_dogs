how to get rid of this error: Rows: 357 Columns: 8── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Delimiter: ","
chr (5): Breed, ward, bite_type, location_type, geographic_area
dbl (3): year, month, day
ℹ Use spec() to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
ℹ Specify the column types or set show_col_types = FALSE to quiet this message.

ChatGPT

The message you’re seeing is a warning about the column specification when loading your CSV file using `read_csv()`. It indicates the types of columns it has detected. If you want to suppress this message, you have a couple of options:

### Option 1: Suppress the Message

You can set `show_col_types = FALSE` in the `read_csv()` function:

```r
clean_data <- read_csv("/Users/sarahlee/Documents/STA304/dangerous_dogs/dangerous_dogs/data/dangerous_dog_clean.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

### Option 2: Explicitly Specify Column Types

If you want to specify the types of columns explicitly to ensure they are read correctly and avoid any surprises, you can use the `col_types` argument. For example, if you know the structure of your data, you could do something like this:

```r
clean_data <- read_csv(
  "/Users/sarahlee/Documents/STA304/dangerous_dogs/dangerous_dogs/data/dangerous_dog_clean.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    Breed = col_character(),
    ward = col_character(),
    bite_type = col_character(),
    location_type = col_character(),
    geographic_area = col_character(),
    year = col_double(),
    month = col_double(),
    day = col_double()
  ),
  show_col_types = FALSE  # Optionally suppress the message
)
```

### Summary

- **Suppress the Message**: Use `show_col_types = FALSE`.
- **Specify Column Types**: Use the `col_types` argument for explicit control.

Choose the option that best fits your needs! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
